# NCBS Seminar on Spatial analysis using R  

This repository hosts scripts and information for a spatial analysis seminar delivered at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (Sept 2022).  

### Pre-seminar instructions  

1.	Please bring your own device, preferably with [R/RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed.  
2. Create a account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) - it's free!.  
3. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

### Seminar details  

The first part of the seminar will cover the basics of spatial analysis within the R programming environment. I will go over useful resources and functionality from packages that are commonly used.  

I will then provide an overview of a recently published study that used [citizen science data to model associations between climate and land cover, and bird species occupancy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.06075). For complete details of the code and analysis associated with this study, please use the following [link](https://github.com/vjjan91/eBirdOccupancy).  

We will then spend some time learning the basics of GitHub and how to implement a reproducible study using R and Git.    

_Caveat_: By no means is this workshop meant to cover all possible types of spatial analyses within R, but the hope is to provide a glimpse of analyses possible. Further, this workshop is meant to cater to users with differing levels of experience in R and spatial analysis and is not meant to be for users with advanced experience in spatial analysis in R.
